K-Means Clustering on Penguins Dataset

This repository demonstrates unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Palmer Penguins dataset
. The goal is to group penguins into clusters based on their physical measurements and analyze cluster characteristics.

Features

Preprocessing and scaling of numeric features.

Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

Implementation of K-Means clustering using scikit-learn.

Visualization of clusters with scatter plots.

Statistical summary of each cluster with groupby and mean aggregation.

Technologies

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

Usage

Preprocess the dataset and scale numeric features.

Run K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters.

Visualize clusters and analyze cluster characteristics.

Outcome

Clear visualization of penguin clusters.

Statistical summary of each cluster helps identify patterns in features like culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass.
